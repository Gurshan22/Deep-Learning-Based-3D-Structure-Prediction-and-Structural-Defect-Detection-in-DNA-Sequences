This research presents a novel and comprehensive deep learning framework for advanced DNA structure prediction and molecular analysis, strategically integrating multidimensional demographic variables with sophisticated sequence-based genomic features to accurately predict three-dimensional structural conformations and systematically identify critical structural defects in DNA molecules. The investigation develops, implements, and rigorously evaluates three distinct and complementary neural network architectures: Dense Neural Networks (DNN) for comprehensive feature processing, Sequential Neural Networks (SNN) for temporal sequence analysis, and innovative Hybrid Neural Networks (HNN) that synergistically combine numerical demographic data with complex sequence-derived molecular features.
Utilizing a meticulously constructed synthetic dataset comprising 536 demographically diverse samples representing varied population genetics, this study achieves remarkable predictive performance with the hybrid architecture demonstrating exceptional superiority across dual prediction tasks: achieving 93.52% accuracy in 3D structure prediction and 87.96% accuracy in structural defect identification. The research makes significant contributions to the emerging field of personalized genomics by establishing robust statistical correlations between demographic determinants and DNA structural variations, with transformative implications for precision medicine, targeted therapeutic interventions, and evidence-based genetic counselling practices.
The framework incorporates state-of-the-art interactive visualization tools and sophisticated 3D molecular modelling capabilities that substantially enhance prediction interpretability and clinical utility. These advanced features render the system highly suitable for both cutting-edge research applications and practical clinical implementations, bridging the critical gap between computational genomics and translational medicine. The findings demonstrate the potential for demographic-aware structural prediction models to revolutionize personalized healthcare approaches and advance our understanding of population-specific genomic architectures.
